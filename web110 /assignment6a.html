      Project management enable us to optimize solutions based on measurable outcomes. The four P's(Plan, Process, People, and Power) form its core, providing timeless principles applicable acreoss evolving technologies. The project lifecycle: initiation, planning, execution, monitoring and controlling, and closing phasesm serves as a fundamental framewok, Project managers play a main role, aligning team and resources with strategic objectives. Risk management is another key aspect, allowing proactive identification and mitigation of potential obstacles (those usually make us wast a lot of time). Learning from the provided materials made me think more about the importance of these principles, especially when dealing with large teams and complex projects. I intend to apply these insights to approach the final project through dividing the steps given for the Gant Chart as a part of the lifecycle, tracking time spent on each step, evaluating proximity to final due date, and enasuaring work quality based on the given rubric.

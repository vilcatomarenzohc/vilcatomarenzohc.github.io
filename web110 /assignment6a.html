    <h1>Final Project Purpose</h1>
    <p>
      For my final project, my primary objective is to not only successfully complete the project itself but also effectively study for the final exam at the same time. The essence of the FP lies in demonstrating our comprehension of the course material, which has been organized into eight weekly themes. My approach involves gathering all the resources and links provided throughout the course and selecting the most informative and concept-rich source related to the weekly topic. Once identified, I plan to immerse myself in a comprehensive review of these selected materials, distilling them into a highly condensed script for the video presentation. My inspiration draws from the 'in-a-nutshell' style videos that summarize complex storylines in a matter of minutes while retaining the core elements of the plot. This strategy will enable me to convey key concepts while maintaining clarity in my multimedia presentation.

    <h1>Assignment 6A</h1>
    <p>
      Project management enable us to optimize solutions based on measurable outcomes. The four P's(Plan, Process, People, and Power) form its core, providing timeless principles applicable acreoss evolving technologies. The project lifecycle: initiation, planning, execution, monitoring and controlling, and closing phasesm serves as a fundamental framewok, Project managers play a main role, aligning team and resources with strategic objectives. Risk management is another key aspect, allowing proactive identification and mitigation of potential obstacles (those usually make us wast a lot of time). Learning from the provided materials made me think more about the importance of these principles, especially when dealing with large teams and complex projects. I intend to apply these insights to approach the final project through dividing the steps given for the Gant Chart as a part of the lifecycle, tracking time spent on each step, evaluating proximity to final due date, and enasuaring work quality based on the given rubric.

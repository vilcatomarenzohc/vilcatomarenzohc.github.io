      In the first activity of part one, 'Complete the following tutorials', I completed the tutorials on Internet Reference Models, Internet Protocols, and the Internet Domain Name System (DNS) from TutorialsPoint. I gained a deeper understanding of the main aspects of the internet. These tutorials explained the layeder structure of the internet, the role of various protocols in data communication, and how thje DNS translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses for routing. This knowledge has immediate applications in my current role, as I work with online services daily. Understanding the internet's reference models and protocols helps me fix network-related issues more effectively and communicate with IT providers properly. It also helps me make informed decisions about internet infrastructure and security in my future career, whether in managing my own business or contributing to larger companies. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, more knowledge about internet technologies will remain invaluable in keeping smooth operations and safeguarding online assets.

      In the second activity of part one, 'Review IP address settings for your local network', I reviewed IP address settings for my local network on macOS. I learned how to navigate and assess various network settings and configurations. This new knowledge is applicable in my current environment, as I primarly use my Macbook for virtual classes, homework, and entertainment. Additionally, macOS is used in some Harper College lectures. While I may not frequently encounter network troubleshooting nowadays, having insights into configuring networks could be useful in the future. It ensures that I may be able to adapt to different network environments seamlessly, whether for academic purposes or personal use, enhancing my overall digital experience and connectivity.

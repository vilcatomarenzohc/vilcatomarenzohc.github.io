      In the first activity of part one, 'Complete the tutorial TutorialsPoint: Internet Services', I got practical understanding of various internet services like HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and DNS. This new knowledge feels useful for improving internet security and efficiency. In my current and future online environments, I can apply these insights by making informed choices about configuring services. For example, when creating and managing websites, I can ensure secure data transfer by using HTTPS for HTTP connections or set up safe FTP configurations to protect sensitive files during transfers, like passwords. For instance, a deeper understanding of DNS empowers me to troubleshoot and optimize website performance, ensuring quick and reliable loading for users. This will also help diagnose and solve network issues effectively. To sumerize, This tutorial has given me a better understanding of internet services, and I plan to use this knowledge practically to enhance security and streamline online activities.

      In the first activity of part one, 'Complete the following tutorials', I completed the tutorials on Internet Reference Models, Internet Protocols, and the Internet Domain Name System (DNS) from TutorialsPoint. I gained a deeper understanding of the main aspects of the internet. These tutorials explained the layeder structure of the internet, the role of various protocols in data communication, and how thje DNS translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses for routing. This knowledge has immediate applications in my current role, as I work with online services daily. Understanding the internet's reference models and protocols helps me fix network-related issues more effectively and communicate with IT providers properly. It also helps me make informed decisions about internet infrastructure and security in my future career, whether in managing my own business or contributing to larger companies. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, more knowledge about internet technologies will remain invaluable in keeping smooth operations and safeguarding online assets.

      In the second activity of part one, 'Review IP address settings for your local network', I reviewed IP address settings for my local network on macOS. I learned how to navigate and assess various network settings and configurations. This new knowledge is applicable in my current environment, as I primarly use my Macbook for virtual classes, homework, and entertainment. Additionally, macOS is used in some Harper College lectures. While I may not frequently encounter network troubleshooting nowadays, having insights into configuring networks could be useful in the future. It ensures that I may be able to adapt to different network environments seamlessly, whether for academic purposes or personal use, enhancing my overall digital experience and connectivity.

      In the activity of part two, 'Test your firewall using a testing service such as Gibson Research: ShieldsUP!', I got to see how secure my network perimeter was and learn about open ports and potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by cyber bad actors. Going forward, I'm planning to make regular firewall checks a part of my routine in both my current and future workplace. Services like ShieldsUP! will be handy in helping me spot and fix any weak spots, ensuring that my network stays nice and secure. Taking these proactive steps feels like the right move, especially in today's digital world, where protecting sensitive information is a top priority. It's all about keeping the virtual fort strong and unbreachable.

      In the activity of part three, 'Review Mozilla: What is accessibility?', I discovered that accessibility encompasses a wide range of considerations, from providing descriptive text for images to structuring content with semantic HTML. In my current and future work environments, I foresee the direct application of these insights by weaving accessibility principles into web design and development projects. This means ensuring that websites are not just visually appealing but also navigable and usable by individuals with disabilities, promoting a more inclusive online experience. By adopting practices like screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, and clear HTML structures, I aim to contribute to a digital landscape that's more equitable and accommodating for all users. This newfound knowledge will shape not only my present endeavors but also my long-term commitment to prioritizing accessibility in web development.

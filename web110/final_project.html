    <h1>Summary</h1>
    <p>
      In this semester we delved into the fundamentals of web technologies and their profound impact on modern society. The Internet transformed global communication, commerce, and education. It is fascinating how this tool has facilitated a revolution in the way we connect, collaborate, and access information, with over 2 billion users by 2011 and an unprecedented flow of data. Web development, intrinsically linked to the Internet, encompasses various key components and concepts, from web browsers that enable content access to the power of HTML and CSS in structuring and styling web pages. JavaScript, a dominant player in this realm, adds dynamic functionalities to websites, making them more interactive. As we navigate the ever-evolving landscape of web technologies, it's evident that the Internet and web development are driving forces shaping our digital world. I hope this course is just the start of the path to transforming my surroundings with these technologies.
